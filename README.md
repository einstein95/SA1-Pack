The SA-1 Pack is a package of patches for activating and optimizing the SA-1
system for the SMW ROM, with emphasis on eliminating slowdown, game limitations
and accelerating the engine to the maximum possible.

What is it?
===========

SA-1 is a co-processor used on some special SNES games, made to work together
with the Super NES CPU and enhance its processing speed, graphics and memory.

With its base 10.74 MHz clock, the SA-1 CPU is four times faster than the
normal SNES CPU processing. The SA-1 CPU and SNES CPU also runs
simultaneously, which can result in five times faster processing over game with
a standard cart setup. With that much power, the Super Accelerator System (SAS)
can be used to handle the SMW engine much faster than the normal, allowing more
sprites to be processed at once, more in-game effects, faster level loading and
much more.

SA-1 Pack not just activates the co-processor, but also modifies a good part of
the game engine to use and explore the chip features, which gives an extreme
boost to the overall performance of the game.

## Game Features
* Makes the game run up to four times faster.
* Increase the maximum amount of sprites at once on screen to 22.
* Increase the maximum amount of sprites on a single sub-level to 255.
* Reduces loading time of all levels and maps.
* Increase the maximum ROM size to 8 MB.
* Offers enhanced bitmap and arithmetic capabilities for better graphics
performance.

## System Features
* 16-bit 65c816 processor clocked at 10.74 MHz.
* 2 kB fast internal work memory (I-RAM), clocked at 10.74 MHz.
* Multi-processor processing, with parallel operating mode and memory sharing
control.
* Large capacity memory, with a total capability of 8 MB of ROM clocked at
10.74 MHz and 256 kB of BW-RAM, clocked at 5.37 MHz.
* High speed arithmetic hardware of multiplication, division and cumulative
sum.
* Bitmap and Character Conversion functions for fast graphics manipulation.
* Custom DMA circuit for fast transfers between ROM, I-RAM and BW-RAM.
* Variable-Length Bit data processing for enhanced algorithms such as graphics
and data compression.
* Super MMC memory mapping capabilities for BW-RAM and bank switching for
multiple ROM image access and mirroring.

Compatibility
=============

SA-1 Pack is the most complex patch ever made to Super Mario World. It modifies
pretty much the entire game, because the patch moves most of the game logic
memory to another region which the SA-1 system can access and modify. In
addition to that, a lot of the game routines are slight edited to call the SA-1
CPU during the most heavy operations and even make some of the routines run in
parallel (SNES and SA-1 executing code at the same time, in parallel). Together
that, some of the game enhancements involves some more deep modifying of the
game engine, for example, the More Sprites enhancement, which expands the
maximum number of sprites to 22 or the level limits expander, which makes it
possible to have up to 255 sprites on a single level and much more...

Fortunately, that does not mean there will be game bugs. Although the patch is
extremely complex, extensive tests and verifications have been done and the
patch is stable and completely functional. In addition to that, when bugs are
found they can be easily fixed without requiring making a new ROM port and
updates are warranted to come quickly, as soon as possible when one finds a
certain bug in most of the games.

The main implications when using the SA-1 patches are resource and emulator
incompatibilities.

## Resource Compatibility

Any patch or tool made for editing Super Mario World must be designed to detect
the presence of the SA-1 Pack and behave properly when the system is present on
the ROM. The resource is responsible for using the correct memory mapping, RAM
remapping and for calling the SA-1 CPU on its code, without having to the user
manually modify it.

Tools made for editing graphics and music are exempt from this, unless if they
edit the ROM directly as well.

Sprites and blocks must be converted for SA-1 compatibility as well, but you
can download the SA-1 Convert Tool which allows converting them automatically
for you.

Overall, the most important is checking for patch and tool compatibility. On
[SMW Central](https://www.smwcentral.net/), you can verify if a certain
resource is compatible or not with SA-1 by checking for the`sa-1`tag in the
submission information.

[Lunar Magic](https://fusoya.eludevisibility.org/lm/index.html) has native SA-1
support since version 2.20.

For more information about converting a certain resource to SA-1 compatibility
manually, check the docs folder and the technical files included, specially the
[Memory Map Summary](docs/memory-map-summary.md).

## Emulator Compatibility

SA-1 is an enhancement chip used on many SNES games. Although quite popular,
unfortunately the SA-1 chip lacks proper emulation support for some of the
known emulators available to download. Older emulators may not have some of
the chip features implemented or may have unstable, slow emulation which can
make the game slower, unstable or even completely unplayable. It's extremely
important to use an accurate and updated emulator when playing not just
regular SA-1 games, but any SMW hack with SA-1 Pack applied. Currently it's
strongly recommended to play SA-1 games with Snes9x 1.56 and bsnes/higan.
Older or different emulators may not work properly.

ZSNES in particular, while an extremely popular emulator (specially on the
last decade), it lacks many SA-1 features and support, which makes it strongly
**not** recommended to play games with. Although I still make (many) efforts
for keeping reasonable compatibility with ZSNES, there's absolutely no warranty
of performance and stability when playing SMW SA-1 games with it.

SA-1 Pack is fully compatible with real hardware. It works on both hacked SA-1
carts and sd2snes, with a good performance.

For more information about emulator and hardware compatibility, check out the
[Known Issues](docs/known-issues.md) document.

Installation
============

As far working with SA-1 can be tedious at start (specially checking for
resource compatibility), with the current development and available compatible
resources, it's already doable to pretty much anyone who got a fair experience
with SMW Hacking to use it.

In order to get started, grab a new clean ROM. Japanese or European versions
will not work.

Now, open the ROM in Lunar Magic and expand it to at least 2MB. **Don't** save
any level nor do any action on the editor.

After expanding, apply sa1.asm to your ROM, using Asar.

Then feel free to test it with your preferred emulator. If it works properly,
somewhere in your emulator it should display SA-1, e.g. ROM+RAM+BAT+SA-1 in
Snes9x. If you're unsure, try editing level 106, change sprite header memory
to 0x08 and insert 20 naked koopas in the level. If all of them display correctly,
SA-1 Pack was successfully inserted.

Now you can apply all other patches/tools that should run before Lunar Magic.
Remember that they should have SA-1 compatibility or else they will likely
corrupt your ROM.

After it, you can finally use Lunar Magic with your ROM. Remember to use at
least version 2.20+.

To enable the double (22 sprites) system, don't forget to change your sprite
header memory to 0x08, except in vanilla boss battles, they won't work
correctly because of the new sprite memory system.

**IMPORTANT:** Since version 1.31 the sprite header index for activing the
22 sprites mode is **0x08** and not 0x10.

Important: If you change the decompression option on Lunar Magic, you must
reapply sa1.asm to your ROM so the proper *fast* GFX decompression routine is
used. This is important for fast level decompression and compatibility wit
advanced resources.

F.A.Q
=====

<dl><dt>
 Q: Is it really hard to work with SA-1 Pack?
</dt><dd>
 A: The main difficulty is at converting .asm resources manually, which is only
 required if your desired resource is not available. Other than that, today
 it's reasonable easy to use SA-1 Pack.
</dd>
<dt>
 Q: After editing my ROM on Lunar Magic, the ROM crashes or glitches before the
 title screen. What's going on?
</dt><dd>
 A: Your Lunar Magic version isn't compatible with SA-1 Pack. Please update to
 at least version 3.00.
</dd>
<dt>
 Q: I can't insert more than 10 sprites on my ROM, why?
</dt><dd>
 A: Please change open the "Change Properties in Sprite Header" dialog and change
 the sprite memory index to <b>08</b>. 
<dt>
 Q: After expanding my ROM to 8MB, ZSNES won't open the ROM anymore.
</dt><dd>
 A: ZSNES doesn't support 8MB ROMs, only up to 6MB. Try restoring your ROM to a
 previous state using Lunar Magic or with a backup. You can also try FuSoYa's
 custom ZSNES build.
</dd>
<dt>
 Q: Whenever I apply a patch to my ROM, it starts crashing.
</dt><dd>
 A: Make sure that the patch is SA-1 compatible. Patches that are not designed
 to work with SA-1 Pack will 99% likely crash your ROM.
</dd>
<dt>
 Q: Whenever I use a certain tool, the ROM crashes as well...
</dt><dd>
 A: Make sure that the tool is SA-1 compatible. Compatible tools will have the
 "sa-1" tag on the SMW Central sections. If the tool you're looking for is not
 compatible with SA-1, try asking for help in the forums for assistance or
 alternatives.
</dd>
<dt>
 Q: If I insert a custom block or custom sprite, the ROM crashes or glitches
 when the block/sprite is present.
</dt><dd>
 A: Blocks and sprites may need to be converted to SA-1. If case the one you
 downloaded is not compatible with SA-1, you can use the SA-1 Convert tool to
 automatically convert them for you.
</dd>
<dt>
 Q: How I can make something compatible with SA-1?
</dt><dd>
   A: Check out the <a href="docs/programming.md">Programming</a> section for more
 information. You will need some ASM knowledge to edit .asm files beforehand.
</dd>
<dt>
 Q: If I change "Compression Options for this ROM" on Lunar Magic, the ROM gets
 a little slower on loading screens. Why?
</dt><dd>
 A: You have to reapply sa1.asm after you change the compression option, since
 SA-1 processes that specific part and it needs a specific decompresser to work
 property.
